                        FAM: When you follow someone and they follow you back, you become FAM. This mutual follow is
                        visible to others, promoting authentic connections rather than inflated follower counts.
                        Views: Giffft shows the number of views on content but does not count likes, reducing the
                        pressure to seek validation through numbers and fostering genuine engagement.
